<h2>Metro Exodus</h2>
<img src="img/capsule_616x353.jpg" alt="TiTle Metro exodus">
<p>Experience this gripping story of survival from start to finish with the Metro Franchise bundle, containing Metro
    2033 Redux, Metro: Last Light Redux, and Metro Exodus and its DLCs (The Two Colonels and Sam's Story DLCs).</p>
<p>Beginning with Metro 2033, follow Artyom as he embarks on a desperate mission to warn the remnants of mankind of a
    terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate
    wastelands above, where your ac1tions will determine the fate of mankind.</p>
<h1>Metro: Last Light</h1>
<p>The saga continues in Metro: Last Light; beneath the ruins of post-apocalyptic Moscow the remnants of mankind are
    besieged by deadly threats from outside – and within. Rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro are
    locked in a struggle for the ultimate power, and a civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of
    the earth forever. As Artyom, burdened by guilt but driven by hope, you hold the key to our survival – the last
    light in our darkest hour.</p>
<p>In the latest chapter, Metro Exodus, Artyom must flee the Metro and lead a band of Spartan Rangers on an incredible,
    continent-spanning journey across post-apocalyptic Russia in search of a new life in the East. You must explore the
    Russian wilderness across vast, non-linear levels and follow a thrilling story-line that spans an entire year
    through spring, summer and autumn to the depths of nuclear winter.</p>
